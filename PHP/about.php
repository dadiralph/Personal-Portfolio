These experiences provided a strong foundation in understanding how technology impacts efficiency and user satisfaction.

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <div class="container">
      
      <p>
      Fueled by a deep-seated desire to not just operate but to actively build and create, I'm now channeling my energy into the compelling world of software development. My background in Ad Operations and Quality Assurance has instilled in me a strong appreciation for efficiency, meticulous attention to detail (honed through campaign optimization at Vintazk Outsourcing and ensuring quality at Bubblebest), and a practical understanding of technical workflows (gained during my IT internship at the Department of Trade and Industry). I'm eager to fuse these experiences with my burgeoning coding skills to contribute meaningfully to innovative and impactful projects.
      </p>
      <p>
      My aim is to transition into a role where I can leverage this unique blend of operational insight and technical aptitude to ensure the software I help develop is not only functional but also robust, user-centric, and built with an inherent understanding of quality from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>
      On the following page, you'll find a closer look at the specific skills and technologies I'm currently immersed in and applying to my projects.

  <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
    <div class="container">
      
      <p>
      Outside the world of code and emerging technologies, I find myself drawn to the strategic depths of board games and the dynamic interplay of basketball – both honing my analytical thinking. The precision engineering and competitive spirit of Formula 1 also captivate my interest, as does the challenge and reward of learning a new language. These diverse pursuits not only offer a creative outlet but also enrich my perspective, bringing fresh insights to my technical endeavors.
